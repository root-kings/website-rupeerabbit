                        <div class="collapsible-body"><span>MI on credit card is given against the existing credit line
                                that a customer has on his card, and the credit limit is blocked for that amount and
                                cannot be used for any further purchase transaction. For eg: If a customer has a Rs. 1
                                lac credit limit on his card and make a purchase transaction of 75,000 using EMI on
                                credit card. In this scenario, the customer will be able to use his card for only
                                25,000 as the rest of the limit is blocked. The limit keeps getting release with every
                                EMI payment made.
                                The main disadvantages of using EMI on credit cards are:
                                1.Transaction amount is restricted by the credit limit.
                                2.Credit limit of the customer is blocked.
                                3.Limited end use as once specific transactions can be converted into EMI.
                                4.Limited re-payment tenure.
                                Personal loan does away with all the above restrictions and is the best choice when it
                                comes to short term borrowing with no hassles.</span></div>

                        <div class="collapsible-body"><span>Repayment of a personal loan is done by issuing post-dated
                                cheques for the entire tenure of the contract. The amount of the post-dated cheque
                                would be the EMI. Some lenders also permit repayment option by way of standing
                                instructions to your bank account or deduction at source from your salary every month.
                                In a personal loan it is necessary for the borrower to draw out the entire loan and the
                                loan is repaid by way of fixed monthly installments.</span></div>

                                1. The amount of loan as compared to your income.
                                2. Length of the repayment period you opt for.
                                3. Credit Profile, which is judged from your CIBIL report.
                                Thus your ability to repay the loan determines the lending rate. Lending rates differ
                                for different
                                financiers and currently range from 11.99% to 28%. You will be able to find the best

                        <div class="collapsible-body"><span>It could happen that things do not go according to plan and
                                you are unable to meet the EMI
                                (equated monthly installment) commitments.
                                First step would be to try to convert the personal loan from an unsecured to a secured
                                loan
                                against assets such as a house, car, mutual funds, and RBI bonds, gold, bank Fixed
                                Deposits,
                                life insurance policy, shares and debentures by asking the bank to restructure your
                                loan. This
                                should ensure that the EMI amount is reduced making it easier to make payments as the
                                rate of
                                interest charged on a secured loan is much less than on unsecured loan.
                                Just in case you feel that you are not gaining from the conversion you can
                                pledge/mortgage the
                                assets you have and obtain a new loan against them and then with that loan amount,
                                pay-off
                                your existing personal loan.
                                But this does not mean that you will not do everything possible to repay the loan in
                                the first place.
                                Loan is a means to acquire something with help and not deceive a lender to waste the
                                resources
                                for unproductive use. So take loans and achieve all your dreams with financial help

                        <div class="collapsible-body"><span>EMI on credit card is given against the existing credit
                                line that a customer has on his card, and
                                the credit limit is blocked for that amount and cannot be used for any further purchase
                                transaction. For eg: If a customer has a Rs. 1 lac credit limit on his card and make a
                                purchasetransaction of 75,000 using EMI on credit card. In this scenario, the customer
                                will be able to use
                                his card for only 25,000 as the rest of the limit is blocked. The limit keeps getting
                                release with
                                every EMI payment made.
                                The main disadvantages of using EMI on credit cards are:
                                1.Transaction amount is restricted by the credit limit.
                                2.Credit limit of the customer is blocked.
                                3.Limited end use as once specific transactions can be converted into EMI.
                                4.Limited re-payment tenure.
                                Business loan does away with all the above restrictions and is the best choice when it

                                (equated monthly installment) commitments.
                                First step would be to try to convert the business loan from an unsecured to a secured
                                loan
                                against assets such as a house, car, mutual funds, and RBI bonds, gold, bank Fixed
                                Deposits,
                                life insurance policy, shares and debentures by asking the bank to restructure your
                                loan. This
                                should ensure that the EMI amount is reduced making it easier to make payments as the
                                rate of
                                interest charged on a secured loan is much less than on unsecured loan.
                                Just in case you feel that you are not gaining from the conversion you can
                                pledge/mortgage the
                                assets you have and obtain a new loan against them and then with that loan amount,
                                pay-off
                                your existing business loan.
                                But this does not mean that you will not do everything possible to repay the loan in
                                the first place.
                                Loan is a means to acquire something with help and not deceive a lender to waste the
                                resources

                                the top of our dashboard, we have a shortcut for the family feature. Just start adding
                                members by entering their PAN numbers. The concerned family member will receive an
                                OTP from Rupeerabbit. You would need to enter that OTP to be able to add a member to
                                your account. Once done, you would be able to see investments made by your
                                familymembers in your account. This access will remain a read-only access and it does
